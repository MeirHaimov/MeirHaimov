### üî• Featured Projects  
- **üöó Smart Parking System**  
Developing an AI-based parking management system called - **ParkVision** using **React Native** for the mobile app and **Django**
for the backend. The system leverages deep learning tools such as **OpenCV, YOLO, and PyTorch** for vehicle detection and
license plate recognition. Integrated with a **Raspberry Pi camera** for real-time data capture, the solution streamlines parking
operations with accurate and efficient management and helps users efficiently find and reserve available parking spots.
- **‚òòÔ∏è Potato Plant Disease Recognition System ‚òòÔ∏è**
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to detect and classify two major potato plant diseases: Early Blight and Late Blight. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image recognition tasks. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the solution helps farmers identify diseases early, preventing crop losses and economic damage, while improving decision-making and overall crop health.

   **üîëKey Features:**
  - CNN-based Model: Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify potato plant leaves.
  - Transfer Learning: Implemented transfer learning using pre-trained models like ResNet and VGG to improve model accuracy and training efficiency.
  - Image Processing & Augmentation: Applied advanced image processing techniques and data augmentation to enhance model generalization and robustness.
  - Optimization: Optimized the model using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
  - Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure high accuracy and reliability.
  
  **üåç Impact:**
  This model offers significant potential in helping farmers by reducing the time needed for disease detection, preventing crop losses, and improving the overall health of potato plants.

- Achieved 96% accuracy in disease classification.
- Reduced potential detection time by approximately 98.33%, from 5 minutes to 5 seconds using the deep learning model.

- **üìÑ Django Blog**  
  A blog built with Django, featuring authentication, comments, and REST API.
