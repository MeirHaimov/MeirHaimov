### 🔥 Featured Projects  
- **🚗 Smart Parking System**  
Developing an AI-based parking management system called - **ParkVision** using **React Native** for the mobile app and **Django**
for the backend. The system leverages deep learning tools such as **OpenCV, YOLO, and PyTorch** for vehicle detection and
license plate recognition. Integrated with a **Raspberry Pi camera** for real-time data capture, the solution streamlines parking
operations with accurate and efficient management and helps users efficiently find and reserve available parking spots.
- **☘️ Potato Plant Disease Recognition System ☘️**
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to detect and classify two major potato plant diseases: Early Blight and Late Blight. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image recognition tasks. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the solution helps farmers identify diseases early, preventing crop losses and economic damage, while improving decision-making and overall crop health.

- **🔑Key Features:**
CNN-based Model: Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify potato plant leaves.
Transfer Learning: Implemented transfer learning using pre-trained models like ResNet and VGG to improve model accuracy and training efficiency.
Image Processing & Augmentation: Applied advanced image processing techniques and data augmentation to enhance model generalization and robustness.
Optimization: Optimized the model using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

- **Impact:**
This model offers significant potential in helping farmers by reducing the time needed for disease detection, preventing crop losses, and improving the overall health of potato plants.
•	Achieved 96% accuracy in disease classification
•	Reduced potential detection time by approximately 98.33%, from 5 minutes to 5 seconds using the deep learning model.
