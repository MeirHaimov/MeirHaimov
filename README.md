### 🔥 Featured Projects  
- **🚗 Smart Parking System**  
Developing an AI-based parking management system called - **ParkVision** using **React Native** for the mobile app and **Django**
for the backend. The system leverages deep learning tools such as **OpenCV, YOLO, and PyTorch** for vehicle detection and
license plate recognition. Integrated with a **Raspberry Pi camera** for real-time data capture, the solution streamlines parking
operations with accurate and efficient management and helps users efficiently find and reserve available parking spots.
